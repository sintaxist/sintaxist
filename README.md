# Resume

Hello, if you are reading it means that I am doing something right 😆.
So... let me introduce myself, I'm Alejandro Canek, although on the web I can be found as @sintaxist (good name, right? ), I've been dedicated to web development and UI design for 2 years, I've worked on more than 20+ projects, so probably You can't find all my works, so I recommend you take a look at my [Figma](https://www.figma.com/@sintaxist) profile, where. you will be able to visualize all my works as UI.

I hope we can work together or just talk 😁.
